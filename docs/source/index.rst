ReliefBox documentation
===================================

**ReliefBox** is a tool for managing the distribution of relief items during humanitarian emergencies.
Given a list of beneficiaries, ReliefBox tracks *who* received aid and *when*, and makes this information
easily available during and after the distribution.

Main features:
- *Easy* to use and *fast* to set up.
- Works both *online* on multiple devices and *offline* on a single device.
- Supports *multiple distributions* at the same time.
- Does **not** support multiple items per beneficiary.
- Does **not** support role-based access control.

The intended use case is *one-off distributions*, i.e. each beneficiary receiving aid only once.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :doc:`install` it yourself.
