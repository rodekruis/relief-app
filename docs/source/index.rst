ReliefBox documentation
===================================

**ReliefBox** is a tool for managing the **distribution of relief items** during humanitarian emergencies.
Given a list of beneficiaries, ReliefBox tracks **who received aid and when**, and makes this information
easily available before, during and after the distribution.

- **Easy** to use and **fast** to set up.
- Works both **online** on multiple devices and **offline** on a single device.
- Supports multiple, independent distributions at the same time.
- Does **not** keep track of multiple distribution to same beneficiaries. The intended use case is **one-off distributions**, i.e. each beneficiary receiving aid only once.
- Does **not** support multiple, distinct items for each beneficiary.
- Does **not** support role-based access control.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :doc:`installation` it yourself.
