ReliefBox documentation
===================================

`ReliefBox <https://relief-system-webapp.azurewebsites.net>`_ is a tool for managing the **distribution of relief items** during humanitarian emergencies.
Given a list of beneficiaries, ReliefBox helps you track **who received aid and when**, and makes this information available before, during and after the distribution. ReliefBox was designed to be **easy** to use and **fast** to set up.

- Works both **online** on multiple devices and **offline** on a single device.
- Supports multiple, independent distributions at the same time.
- Does **not** support deduplication of beneficiaries across distributions, i.e. does **not** check if a beneficiary in a given distribution is a recipient in another one.
- Does **not** support distribution of multiple, distinct items to each beneficiary.
- Does **not** support role-based access control.

how to :doc:`install <installation>` it yourself.
