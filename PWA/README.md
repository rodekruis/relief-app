# Reliefbox Progressive web app
Offline version of reliefbox, built using typescript and relying heavily on service workers and IDB database. Upon installation the app works 100% offline, from this point on no backend calls are done anymore.

### During development

Make sure all terninal tabs are in the PWA directory, then run:
`npm start` to launch the local server
`tsc --watch` to make sure typescript files get compiled as you code
`npm run test -- --watch` to make sure run as you code

* All new files need to be added to `CachePathFileService`
* All new `FetchEventHandler` classes need to be added to `FetchEventHandlers`

#### Versioning
The apps version is stored in package.json and index.html current way to update this is by simply find replacing the previous version with the new one, making sure only the two files above are effected.

### Architercture / dataflow

1. HTTP requests are handled by serviceworker
2. Service worker dispatches request to `FetchEventHandlers`
3. `FetchEventHandlers` chooses which `FetchEventHander` should handle the request
4. `FetchEventHandler` handles the request and serves a new page using `ResponseTools` and using a service if there's been a need for shared or separated logic.
5. `ResponseTools` leverages the mustache templating system to render pages with the least amount of redundancy

#### Special note about templating
All pages exept index.html are rendered using template.html. The reason this isn't done for index.html is that the templating system is part of what's handled by the serviceworker, which isn't used yet when loading this first page. Because of this, there's some overlap between index.html and template.html

### IDB Database schema

* Beneficiary
    * Contains all the info of a beneficary
      * As provided by user from spreadsheet
    * Contains the info regarding the receival of goods
    * Containtains the info to which distribution the beneficiary belongs
* Distribution
    * Contains all the info of a distribution

### Third party code used
* [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com) (PWA/public/ExternalLibraries/xlsx.full.min.js)
  * For handling spreadsheat files
* [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) (PWA/public/ExternalLibraries/mustache.js)
    * For html templating

  * For barcode scanning
* [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io) (PWA/public/ExternalLibraries/bulma.css)
  * For page styling styling

### Deployment
* Compiled code is found in public folder
  * As configured in PWA/tsconfig.json
* Github actions is used for deployment of that folder
  * on push as configured in .github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-black-stone-02fb10f03.yml
  * app will be deployed to reliefbox.510.global

Installing
  * App can be installed and launched from homescreen
    ‚úÖ iPhone 15 (0.24.4)
    üü† Alcatel 1B
      Add to homepage stopped working on this device. It says open reliefbox instead.
      Currently best known workaround: launching the app from the app launcher. Since this doesn't seem to happen on other
      android devices, it may be device specific thing, where PWA data isn't removed properly.

          Very minor: when template has been downloaded before, lives in downloads and name isn't changed, app navigates straight to distribution

#### Regression observations
üü† Huawei P30 (0.24.2), Alcatel 1B (0.24.4)
  In some cases an action may result in "This site can't be reached" message. Restarting the app or going back and performing the action again, seems to resolve this. May be more stable on newer devices (currently unclear).
